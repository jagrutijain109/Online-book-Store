    <h4><b> How does Bookshop work with independent bookstores?</b></h4>
<p>Bookshop supports indies in two ways: 10% of regular sales on Bookshop.org are added to an earnings pool that is evenly divided and distributed to independent bookstores every six months.<br>

Stores that are affiliates, who sell books online using Bookshop (by sharing links their Bookshop link on social media, email newsletters, or on their websites) earn 30% of the cover price on any sales they generate, without having to do the work of keeping inventory, picking, packing, shipping or handling complaints and returns. (30% of the cover price is the entire profit margin - Bookshop doesn’t earn money off bookstore sales, all profits go to the store.)<br>

    All orders are fulfilled through Ingram.</p>

    <h4><b>How does Bookshop promote local bookstores?</b></h4>
<p>Every receipt we email customers informs them about the bookstores near them.<br>

If a Bookshop customer opts in, their local bookstore will be given their email address for direct marketing.<br>

    Affiliate stores can create recommendation lists (staff picks, etc) on Bookshop, boosting their visibility and earning a commission on every sale generated from the list.</p>
